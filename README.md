#Problem: Profit seeking tutor platoforms, without any motivation and community feel. For adults and not kids. 

# Disrupt the middle and secondary school education for black kids
#Motivate them towards sciences
# Connect the black science community
# Platform to show off work to the community and get inspired from others' work
# Daily winners to recognize developing science related projects

# Incentivize them with building profile with activity
# Motivate them by connecting them with black leaders in today's technology

# Provide them with a one place to submit and show their work, get feedback,
# get motivation, get help, connect to the black community in technology

# Will not segregate, but target black kids to use the platform
